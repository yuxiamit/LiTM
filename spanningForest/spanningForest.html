<h2>Spanning Forest (SF):</h2> 

<p>
Given a undirected graph return a spanning tree (ST), or spanning
forest (SF) if the graph is not connected.  For timing purposes the
input can either be an adjacency array format with all edges appearing
in both directions, or an edge array with all edges appearing in just
one direction.  Any spanning tree/forest is valid.
</p>

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
The input is a graph in the in the <a
href="benchmarks/graphIO.html">edge graph</a> format.  The
output is a sequence of integers corresponding to the locations of all
the edges in the spanning tree (or forest) with respect to the
input (zero based).  The output needs to be in the <a
href="benchmarks/sequenceIO.html">sequence</a> format.  The edge
indices need not be sorted in the output.
</p>

<p>
For timing purposes any code is allowed to covert from the edge array
format to an adjacency format outside of the timed code, but is not allowed
to do any other processing of the graph (e.g. reordering to improve locality).
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

<p>
Each distribution should be run for <tt>n=10,000,000</tt>.  
The edge weights are selected at random.
The weights
used for average time are given in parentheses.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
(1) Random local graph with approximately 10 edges per vertex.  This
graph is generated so that the probability of each edge out of a
vertex is biased to nearby vertices.

<blockquote>
<tt>randLocalGraph -d 3 -m &lt;5*n&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) An RMAT graph with parameters (.3,.1,.1,.5) and about 5n edges.

<blockquote>
<tt>rMatGraph -a .5 -b .1 -m &lt;5*n&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) A 2 dimensional grid.
<blockquote>
<tt>gridGraph -d 2 &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
